This is a sample project meant to render data from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grindinggear/skilltree-export/refs/heads/master/data.json

todos:
 - incorporate group information to determine node positioning
 - determine "viewing window" cordinates
 - render each group within cordinates as well as attached edges within the "viewing window".
 - re-render on "viewing window" move or resize
 - come up with better name than "viewing window"
 - add images?
 - allow allocation/ unallocation of nodes
